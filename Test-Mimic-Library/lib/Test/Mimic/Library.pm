    # The best way to think of the key generator is as a hint to the mimic system. A constant map to
    # 'the key' would work provided that all calls to a given subroutine occur in order. If a smarter
    # map is used then the mimic system will be more flexible. Call order only must be preserved in each set
    # of calls generated by the inverse map of each distinct key. Of course, if one call produces data that
    # another requires it doesn't really make sense to change the order (in either the playback _or_ record
    # stages).
    # 
    # NOTE: The passed subroutine should probably not use the stored reference information. This is because
    # out of order calls could then break. Consider subroutines foo and bar. Both take a hash
    # reference. Suppose that in the recording stage foo is called first, bar second and that the same
    # reference is passed both times. If the reference is created by the user, i.e. not returned from a
    # mimicked subroutine or otherwise seen by the recorder, then foo will end up naming the reference.
    # foo's key generator will not be able to include the reference name and will perhaps instead perform
    # a straightforward stringification of the hash. bar's key generator on the other hand will be able to
    # use the fact that we are monitoring the reference and may instead create a key like '[ VOLATILE, 47 ]'.
    # Now suppose that in the playback stage the call order is reversed. The hash reference isn't named until
    # the call to foo, so there is no way bar can recognize it.
    #
    # NOTE: Or maybe scratch all of that. The above problem sucks, but the alternative is worse. Suppose we
    # do a _light_encode and then a stringification. If we played the object into existence then it is tied.
    # If it is tied and we examine it we will consume it's output. Even we added logic to halt the
    # consumption we don't have access to the most recent state of the object. Similarly, in the record phase
    # we don't know what the next access will be when gen_arg_key is called, so we can't approximate state
    # by considering the history information. We could allow gen_arg_key to cause history to build up like
    # it was a user call, but then we are enforcing call order on the set of subroutines that share
    # arguments. This is definitely a lesser of, err... 4 or 5, evils situation.
    #
    # NOTE: Additionally, you should avoid any calls to monitor, monitor_args or encode. These have the side
    # effect of naming passed values which will break the built in monitor_args/play_args paradigm.

# So you want to build your own key generator? That's great. One rule: Never ever ever view the state of the

# a single alias in the list, an array element of a dereferenced alias, an element of the array element
# dereferenced as a hash etc., that you wish to examine _at all_ you must first call get_id on the component.
# If it returns undef you can look at it, but if it is an aggregate you need to use get_id on it's components
# as well. If undef is not returned, then you will be given an index corresponding to the reference. It is
# guaranteed to be unique over the execution of the program and stable between the record and playback
# phases. This is due to the fact that what you think are real variables in the playback phase are really
# tied variables. They don't have any state and if you try to look at them you will just consume their fake

=head1 NAME

Test::Mimic::Library - Perl library supporting the Test::Mimic suite. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::Mimic::Library qw< encode >;

  my $coded_val = encode( 'a string', 0 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Mimic::Library provides a number of tools required in common by Test::Mimic, Test::Mimic::Recorder,
and Test::Mimic::Generator. It also stores internally certain portions of the recording.

=over

=item init_records()

Prepares the library for a new recording.

=cut

=item load_records($file_name)

Loads the portion of the recording specific to the library. Prepares for playback. Dies on any
IO errors.

=cut

=item get_references()

Returns the reference table. This subroutine is for use by generated code files and should
be considered private to the Test::Mimic suite.

=cut

=item write_records($file_name)

Write the portion of the recording specific to the library. Dies on any IO errors.

=cut

=item descend($dir_name)

Changes the current directory to $dir_name creating it if necessary. Dies on IO errors.

=cut

=item execute( $package, $subroutine_name, $behavior_hash, $args )

Emulates "$package::$subroutine_name" based on the information stored in $behavior_hash given
$args. This subroutine should be considered private to the Test::Mimic suite.

=cut

=item gen_arg_key_by($preferences)

Accepts a hash reference describing which key generator to use given package and subroutine names.
It should have the following structure:

{
    'key' => \&generic_sub,
    'packages' => {
        'Foo::Bar' => {
            'key' => \%more_specific,
            'subs' => {
                'foo' => {
                    'key' => \&most_specific,
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Each of the subroutines should accept an array reference to the arguments and return a key suitable for use
in a hash. Furthermore, they must be the same from run to run and MUST use get_id if they access the state
of any particular argument.

=cut

=item gen_arg_key( $package, $subroutine, $args )

Accepts the name of the package, the name of the subroutine currently being emulated (typically with
execute) and an array reference to the arguments. Returns a hash key based on those arguments using
the requested key generator, or, if none was specified, the default key generator. The generator will be
selected from most to least specific. The default is to encode the arguments by expanding references into
values for 2 levels and then merely note the type. The ids returned by get_id are used instead if an
argument is being micked. stringify is used to convert the above structure into a key.

=item get_id($value)

When constructing a key in your generator you can't wildly examine any old argument. This is because
the arguments are actually tied values and you will probably consume their state. Call get_id first.
If undef is returned you can proceed, but if you have an aggregate you must use get_id recursively.
Otherwise you will be given a unique integer id. Incorporate this into your key instead and do not
examine the state.

=cut

=item stringify_by($coderef)

Accepts a reference to a subroutine that takes a single argument and returns a stringified
version of it. This subroutine will then be used for all stringification in the Test::Mimic suite. It is
important that identical structures stringify to the same value from one run to another. Specifically, the
order of hash keys must remain the same or the default key generator will break. If you really need to you
could ignore this, but you would need a different key generator.

=cut

=item stringify($value)

Returns a stringified version of $value. The behavior of stringify can be set with stringify_by. If this
was not done then a default stringifier will be used.

=cut

=item destringify_by($coderef)

Accepts a reference to a subroutine that is the inverse of the subroutine that stringify_by was given.
All destringification done in the Test::Mimic suite will then use this subroutine.

=cut

=item destringify($stringified_value)

The inverse of stringify.

=cut

=item monitor_args_by($preferences)

Accepts a hash reference describing which argument monitor to use given package and subroutine names.
It should have the following structure:

{
    'monitor_args' => \&generic_sub,
    'packages' => {
        'Foo::Bar' => {
            'monitor_args' => \%more_specific,
            'subs' => {
                'foo' => {
                    'monitor_args' => \&most_specific,
                }
            }
        }
    } 
}       
            
Each of the subroutines should accept an array reference to the arguments and return a scalar representing
the history of the monitored arguments. Only those arguments the user considers important need be monitored.

=cut

=item monitor_args( $package, $subroutine, $arguments )

Accepts the package and name of the subroutine being called along with an array reference to its arguments.
Monitors the arguments with the argument monitor requested with a call to monitor_args_by, or, if none was
requested, the default. This is simply to monitor each argument that is not read only. Returns a scalar
that should passed to play_args during the playback phase.

=cut

=item play_args_by($preferences)

Accepts a hash reference describing which argument player to use given package and subroutine names.
It should have the following structure:

{
    'play_args' => \&generic_sub,
    'packages' => {
        'Foo::Bar' => {
            'play_args' => \%more_specific,
            'subs' => {
                'foo' => {
                    'play_args' => \&most_specific,
                }
            }
        }
    }   
}       
            
Each of the subroutines should accept an array reference to the arguments and the scalar returned by
monitor_args. They should hijack the arguments as necessary and need not return anything.

=cut

=item play_args( $package, $subroutine, $arguments, $coded_arguments )

Accepts the package and name of the subroutine being called, an array reference to its arguments and
the scalar returned by monitor_args. The arguments will be hijacked as specified with play_args_by, or,
if no behavior was specified, the default -- which corresponds to the default monitor_args behavior.

=cut

=item monitor($value)

Accepts an arbitrary scalar, ensures that its value over time will be recorded (if it is a reference), and
returns a scalar representing it. This return value will be suitable for stringification.

=cut

=item encode( $value, $volatility_depth )

Accepts an arbitrary scalar and the depth at which the dereferenced value may be subject to change (assuming
that it is a reference). 0 is for the passed reference itself, 1, for example, may be the elements of an
array reference, but not the array itself. Circular structures are not allowed unless they are contained
entirely below the volatility depth. The history of the values above the volatility depth is not recorded.
Returns a scalar representing the value. This will be suitable for stringification.

=cut

=item decode($coded_value)

Given the coded value returned by encode or monitor returns an approximation to the original. This method is
somewhat smart -- the same coded value passed to decoded will return the exact same reference, i.e.
refaddr( decode($coded_value) ) == refaddr( decode($coded_value) ). If history was recorded, as opposed to
purely state, this information will be used when the user accesses the variable.

=cut

=item play($coded_value)

Given the coded value returned by decode returns an approximation to the original. Note that decode can
handle anything returned by either monitor or encode, but play can handle only monitor returns, so it
almost always makes sense to use decode.

=cut
